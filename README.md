Authorization-Enhanced Mail System (AEMS)

Electronic mail (email) is the most pervasive form of business information exchange. Email is often used not only as an interpersonal communication tool, but also as the default choice to send files. In this draft proposal the [User-Managed Access][1] (UMA) authorization framework is proposed to address data storage, access control and data transfer limitations of current mail systems.
